## [v0.2.8-alpha] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- `FormatActressName` shared helper in `internal/models/movie.go` deduplicating `Actress.FullName()` and `ActressInfo.FullName()` implementations
- `ScraperOption` and `ScraperChoice` types moved from `internal/api/contracts` to `internal/models/` with backward-compatible aliases, eliminating reverse dependency where all 14 scrapers imported the API layer
- `JobRepositoryInterface.Upsert()` method replacing read-then-write `FindByID` → `Create`/`Update` pattern with single atomic operation
- `UpdateRequest` struct for `POST /api/v1/batch/{id}/update` with `force_overwrite`, `preserve_nfo`, `preset`, `scalar_strategy`, `array_strategy`, `skip_nfo`, `skip_download` fields
- `skip_nfo` and `skip_download` fields on `OrganizeRequest` for `POST /api/v1/batch/{id}/organize`
- Update options UI in review page header (force overwrite, preserve NFO, skip NFO, skip download toggles) with collapsible options panel
- Organize options UI in destination settings card (skip NFO, skip download toggles)
- Older-than-days cleanup picker on Jobs page with "Clean History" and "Clean Events" buttons and client-side validation
- Version check section in ServerSettingsSection: current/latest version display, "Update available" badge, "Check for Updates" button, error state handling
- `getVersionStatus()` and `checkVersion()` API client methods
- `VersionStatusResponse` TypeScript interface with error field
- Server-side validation rejecting `force_overwrite` + `preserve_nfo` as mutually exclusive (returns 400)
- `preset` binding validation (`oneof=conservative gap-fill aggressive`)
- 1MB request body size cap on update endpoint via `io.LimitReader`

### Changed

- Javstash scraper `module.go` proxy declaration changed from value type `config.ProxyConfig` to pointer type `*config.ProxyConfig`, matching the pattern used by all other 13 scrapers
- `AggregatorOptions` and `Aggregator` struct fields changed from concrete `*database.GenreReplacementRepository`/`*database.ActressAliasRepository` to interface types `database.GenreReplacementRepositoryInterface`/`database.ActressAliasRepositoryInterface`
- `processUpdateJob` and `processUpdateMode` now accept `*UpdateOptions` parameter for configurable update behavior
- `processOrganizeJob` now accepts `skipNFO` and `skipDownload` parameters
- `updateBatchJob` handler now parses optional `UpdateRequest` body (backward compatible with empty body), validates job existence/status before body parsing, and returns 400 for malformed JSON
- `persistToDatabase` uses `Upsert` instead of `FindByID` + `Create`/`Update`, eliminating persistence race condition
- All 14 scraper module.go files updated to import `models.ScraperOption`/`models.ScraperChoice` instead of `contracts.ScraperOption`/`contracts.ScraperChoice`
- Downloader HTTP client creation deferred until actually needed — `skip_download=true` no longer triggers downloader setup, preventing proxy/registry errors on NFO-only updates
- `preserve_nfo` now uses `PreserveExisting` merge strategy (not `PreferNFO`) to prevent blanking fields when existing NFO is incomplete
- `preserve_nfo` takes final precedence after preset resolution, preventing silent override
- DisplayTitle templating runs for ALL update paths (including `force_overwrite`), not just the NFO merge block
- Preview `$effect` reactive to skip toggles via `void` references; retry path persists last update options and skip flags
- Force Overwrite and Preserve NFO made mutually exclusive in UI via reactive `$effects`
- Test databases switched from in-memory shared-cache SQLite to temp file-based SQLite with WAL mode, eliminating `database table is locked` flaky test failures under concurrency
- Cross-platform path utility (`path.ts`) with `splitPath`, `buildPathUp`, `buildBreadcrumbPath`, `isRootPath` functions for Windows/Unix path handling
- FileBrowser breadcrumb navigation, "go up" button, and path construction now use cross-platform path utility instead of Unix-only logic
- OperationRow truncated paths now show 40/60 head-tail split with click-to-expand/collapse
- 54 files changed, ~1,192 lines added, ~468 lines removed

## [v0.2.7-alpha] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- `strings.Fields` replacing character-by-character `splitActressName` concatenation
- O(1) scanner extension map lookup replacing linear scan
- `DefaultFlattenConfig` and `DefaultFlattenConfigWithRaw` helpers (`internal/scraperutil/flatten.go`) with `FlattenOverrides` struct for all 14 scrapers
- Rescrape handler decomposition into focused files: `rescrape_scrape.go`, `rescrape_update.go`, `rescrape_validate.go`, `rescrape_poster.go`
- `BatchProcessOptions` and `BatchScrapeOptions` structs replacing positional parameters
- `AggregateWithPriority` method on `AggregatorInterface` for priority-based aggregation

- Batch job processing uses options structs instead of positional parameters
- Mocks regenerated with updated `AggregatorInterface` and `MovieRepositoryInterface` signatures
- 146 files changed, ~4,057 lines added, ~2,382 lines removed

### Fixed

- Unauthenticated users cannot create admin accounts via `/auth/setup` without bootstrap secret or local access
- Authenticated API endpoints reject excessive requests from a single IP with 429 response
- Invalid `sort_by` query parameters rejected with 400 instead of being passed to the database
- Session cookies have Secure flag set when request arrives via HTTPS reverse proxy
- HTTP response bodies fully drained before close on all error paths — no leaked connections
- Job cleanup goroutine stops cleanly when application shuts down
- Concurrent access to BatchJob fields passes race detector with no warnings
- Download errors for covers, posters, and trailers visible in logs and API responses
- Cache miss errors distinguishable from actual database failures in code
- Job queue persistence failures visible in job status
- Review page explicitly requests full batch data (`include_data=true`) to prevent blank editor
- Slim polling by default for `BackgroundJobIndicator` and `ProgressModal` — avoids unnecessary payload overhead
- Genre replacement POST/DELETE routes under rate-limited `writeProtected` group
- `GetStatusSlim` deep-copies `FieldSources` and `ActressSources` maps to prevent shared mutable state
- Preview effect gated during organize polling to avoid redundant `/preview` API calls

### Removed

- `normalizeJSONLDImageURL` dead code from `internal/scraper/dmm/jsonld.go`
- Ineffective first loop from `extractDescriptionNewSite` in `internal/scraper/dmm/video_dmm.go`

### Security

- Rate limiting protects write endpoints (scrape, batch, proxy, auth, genre mutations) from per-IP abuse
- Sort-by whitelist prevents SQL injection via query parameters
- Bootstrap secret prevents first-arriver takeover of `/auth/setup`
- Secure cookie flag prevents session cookie leakage over HTTP behind reverse proxy

## [v0.2.6-alpha] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- SSRF protection package (`internal/ssrf`) with `NewSSRFSafeClient()`, `WrapTransportWithSSRFCheck()`, and `CheckRedirect()` validation blocking private/loopback/link-local IPs
- Typed scraper error model (`models.ScraperError`) with categorized error kinds (network, parsing, not-found, rate-limit, auth, timeout, context-cancelled)
- Config redaction utility (`internal/config/redact.go`) for safe logging of sensitive fields (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Panic recovery middleware for batch processing with structured error reporting
- Job queue improvements: context-aware cancellation, improved state transitions, structured error aggregation
- Batch query support for movie repository (`FindMoviesByIDs`, `FindMoviesByContentIDs`) reducing N+1 database queries
- Translation service typed errors with retry classification
- Panic recovery tests for batch execute pipeline

### Changed

- Context propagation threaded through all 14 scrapers: `.SetContext(ctx)` on every resty request in ctx-aware methods
- Context threaded through full DMM actress thumbnail chain: `parseHTML` → `extractActresses` → `extractActressFromLink` → `tryActressThumbURLs` → `extractRomajiVariantsFromActressPageCtx`
- Context threaded through JavDB `Search` retry and `ScrapeURL` paths via `fetchPageDirectCtx`
- Context threaded through DMM `FetchWithBrowser` as chromedp parent context
- Context threaded through `DownloadMediaFiles` → `DownloadAll` chain
- Aggregator simplified with typed scraper errors replacing ad-hoc error classification
- Worker pool and scraper task pipeline refactored for structured error handling
- Downloader retry logic improved with per-error-kind backoff strategies
- Temp API handlers now use `ssrf.NewSSRFSafeClient()` instead of raw `http.Client`
- Proxy test client uses `resty.NoRedirectPolicy()` to prevent open-redirect SSRF
- Removed unused context-free wrapper functions (`fetchPageDirect`, `extractRomajiVariantsFromActressPage`, etc.)
- 135 files changed, ~2,659 lines added, ~1,265 lines removed

### Fixed

- SSRF redirect bypass: proxy test and temp API handlers now validate redirect destinations against internal IPs
- Scraper context cancellation gaps: all scraper HTTP requests now respect caller context for proper timeout/cancel propagation
- DMM actress thumbnail fallback now cancellable (previously used `context.Background()` for romaji lookup and HEAD probes)
- JavDB ScrapeURL retry path now respects caller context instead of spawning untracked requests
- Batch organize goroutine immediately cancelled due to deriving context from `c.Request.Context()` instead of `context.Background()`

### Security

- SSRF hardening: `NewSSRFSafeClient()` blocks connections to loopback, private, and link-local IP ranges (prevents cloud metadata credential exfiltration via `169.254.169.254` and internal service access)
- SSRF redirect validation: `CheckRedirect()` blocks HTTP redirects to internal IP addresses
- Config redaction prevents API keys and tokens from leaking into logs
